**Contribution statement**: 
+Daryl: Implemented pairing 1 and 2 for the low dimensional data and tuned the respective algorithms for the best matching method (based on ATE). Contributed to slides on pairing 1 and 2, as well as the motivations for propensity matching.
+Peter created both of the stratification algorithms, translating the theoretical mathematics of the research document into code, including an alternate method that required extensive knowledge of dplyr and regression, presented for the team, and drew the conclusion about which algorithms were the best. 
+Yushi: Calculated the propensity score using logistic regression, implemented Doubly Robust Estimation algorithm. Contributed to the presentation slides. 
+Yuqi: Created the Linear Propensity Score using logistic regression (pairing 5), calculated the ATE, ATE error and running time for low dimension and high dimension, participated in the every meeting and contributed to the the presentation slides.
+Renyin: Created summary report on the algorithms. Implemented pairing 1 and 2 for high and low dimensional data. Helped Peter with understanding the alternative method on stratification. Modified algorithm for pairing 5.
